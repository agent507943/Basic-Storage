- ACLs: `show access-lists`, `show ip interface` to see applied ACLs.
- Change STP mode: (platform dependent) `spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst`.
- Configure VLAN SVI on layer-3 switch:
- DHCP relay (ip helper-address): forwards DHCP broadcast requests from clients across routed networks to a centralized DHCP server.
- DHCP server: issues IP configuration (address, mask, gateway, DNS, options).
- Example Redistribute OSPF into BGP with route-map:
- Hardening: limit management plane access (ACLs to management interfaces), use SSH keys, enable AAA, and enable logging to a secure syslog or SIEM.
- High availability: configure active/standby or active/active with state sync for session preservation during failover.
- Interfaces: `show interfaces`, `show interfaces status`, `show ip interface brief`.
- Monitor with `show policy-map interface` and `show mls qos interface`.
- NAT: `show ip nat translations`, `clear ip nat translation *` (use with caution).
- NTP: `ntp server <ip>` for time sync.
- Option 150 / 66: TFTP server(s) for IP phone provisioning.
- Option 3: router (default gateway).
- Root placement: set `spanning-tree vlan <vlan> root primary` or adjust priority.
- Routing: `show ip route`, `show ip bgp summary`, `show ip ospf neighbor`.
- Saving config: `copy running-config startup-config` or `write memory`.
- Set access VLAN on an interface:
- Syslog: `logging host <ip>` and `logging trap <level>`.
- Use `show ip route` to verify redistributed routes and tags.
- Use `show` commands on the platform (e.g., `show access-list`, `show nat detail`, product-specific commands) and check logs for dropped traffic.
- Use class-maps and policy-maps to shape and police traffic.
- Use named ACLs (`ip access-list extended NAME`) for clarity.
- VLANs: `show vlan brief`, `show mac address-table`.
- Verify: `show etherchannel summary`, `show running-config interface port-channel 1`.
- View STP: `show spanning-tree`.
- Viewing configs: `show running-config`, `show startup-config`.
- Zones / interfaces: group interfaces into security zones and apply policies between zones.
- `debug ip dhcp server` / `debug ip dhcp client` — use carefully in lab/maintenance windows
- `nslookup` / `dig` from a client or management host to verify resolution.
- `show interfaces status`
- `show ip dhcp binding` — list active leases
- `show ip dhcp pool` — pool usage and statistics
- `show ip interface brief`
- `show vlan brief`
Verify: `show ip bgp summary`, `show ip bgp neighbors`.
Verify: `show ip ospf neighbor`, `show ip ospf database`.
